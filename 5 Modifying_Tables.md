# Modifying a Table in MySQL

As your application grows or requirements change, you may need to make changes to existing tables.  
MySQL provides several `ALTER` and related statements for such modifications.

---

## Renaming a Table
Use the `RENAME TABLE` command to change the name of an existing table.

```sql
RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;
```

---

## Dropping a Table
To permanently delete a table and all of its data:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

---

## Renaming a Column
To rename a column in an existing table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN old_column_name TO new_column_name;
```

---

## Dropping a Column
To remove a column from a table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

---

## Adding a Column
To add a new column to an existing table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name datatype constraints;
```

**Example:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN gender VARCHAR(10);
```

---

## Modifying a Column
To change the data type or constraints of an existing column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY COLUMN column_name new_datatype new_constraints;
```

**Example:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE students MODIFY COLUMN name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL;
```

---

## Changing the Order of Columns
To change the order of columns in a table, use the `AFTER` keyword:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype AFTER another_column_name;
```

> ⚠️ Always review changes on production databases carefully.  
> Use `DESCRIBE table_name;` to verify structure **before and after modifications.**
