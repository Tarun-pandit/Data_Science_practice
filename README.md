# 🔢 Learning NumPy with Python

This repository documents my progress in learning **NumPy**, a fundamental Python library for numerical computing. The exercises and examples are based on tutorials and personal practice, using **Google Colab** for running and experimenting with code.

## 📚 What I'm Learning

- Installing and importing NumPy
- Creating NumPy arrays (1D, 2D, 3D)
- Array indexing and slicing
- Array operations (arithmetic, broadcasting)
- Useful NumPy functions (`np.mean`, `np.sum`, `np.max`, etc.)
- Boolean indexing and filtering
- Reshaping and flattening arrays
- Random number generation with `np.random`
- Performance comparison with Python lists

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3** (via Google Colab)
- **NumPy**

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Open any notebook in the `notebooks/` folder via **Google Colab**
2. Make sure NumPy is installed:
   ```python
   !pip install numpy
   ```
3. Run the cells to follow along with the code
4. Modify or extend examples to deepen understanding

## ✅ Requirements

Content of `requirements.txt`:

```
numpy
```

Install packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
