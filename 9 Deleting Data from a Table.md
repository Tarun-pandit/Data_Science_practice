# Deleting Data from a Table

This guide explains how to remove records from a table using the **DELETE** statement.  
It covers deleting specific rows using the **WHERE** clause and the consequences of deleting all rows.

---

## 1. Basic Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Explanation:**
- **DELETE FROM** → Specifies the table from which to remove rows.  
- **WHERE** → Filters which rows should be deleted.  

⚠️ **Important:** If you omit the **WHERE** clause, **all rows** in the table will be deleted.

## 2. Example Table

| id | name         | age | grade |
|----|---------------|-----|--------|
| 1  | Ayesha Khan   | 16  | 10th   |
| 2  | Ravi Sharma   | 17  | 12th   |
| 3  | Meena Joshi   | 15  | 9th    |

## 3. Delete a Specific Row

Example: Delete student with **id = 2**
```sql
DELETE FROM student
WHERE id = 2;
```

---

## 4. Delete Rows Based on a Condition

Example: Delete all students in **9th grade**
```sql
DELETE FROM student
WHERE grade = '9th';
```

---

## 5. Delete Rows Using Comparison Operators

Example: Delete all students **younger than 16**
```sql
DELETE FROM student
WHERE age < 16;
```

---

## 6. Delete Rows Where a Column is NULL

Example: Delete students with **no grade assigned**
```sql
DELETE FROM student
WHERE grade IS NULL;
```

---

## 7. Delete All Rows (Use with Caution)

Example: Remove all data from the **student** table
```sql
DELETE FROM student;
```

This deletes all rows but **retains the table structure**.

---

## 8. Completely Remove the Table

To delete the **table itself** (not just the data), use:
```sql
DROP TABLE student;
```

This removes **both the data and the table structure**.

---

## 9. Verify After Deletion

Check the contents of the table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM student;
```

---

✅ **Summary:**
- Use **DELETE FROM** to remove rows safely.  
- Always include **WHERE** to avoid accidental mass deletion.  
- Use **DROP TABLE** only when you want to permanently remove the table structure.
